    content: "For this week's blog post, I built an iOS app on Expo Go, using React Native and Typescript. It's a very simple app that's just meant to simulate the LinkedIn user experience.\n\nI have started by populating it with funny posts, as you can see we'll be having Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella as a guest speaker next class! I want to further work on it as a comedy platform, using an LLM API to generate a funny post everytime I load the app."

    content: "My name is Fernando De Abreu Pires, I'm originally from Brazil and moved here to the U.S. when I was 10 years old, now I'm a senior here at FSU studying Finance and Management Information Systems.\n\nUpon graduation, I'll be working at Citibank as a Trader in New York City, living with fellow bum, Bruno. In my free time, I like to vibecode, go to the gym, and watch soccer.\n\nI chose to take this course because I have a strong passion with keeping up with emerging technologies, and the opportunity to be exposed to it in-person fascinated me; coincidentally, it fulfills my SIP credit requirement. \n\nAttached is an image of my excuse for missing Tuesday's and Thursday's classes."
