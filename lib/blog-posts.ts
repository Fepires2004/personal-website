    content: "My name is Fernando De Abreu Pires, I'm originally from Brazil and moved here to the U.S. when I was 10 years old, now I'm a senior here at FSU studying Finance and Management Information Systems.\n\nUpon graduation, I'll be working at Citibank as a Trader in New York City, living with fellow bum, Bruno. In my free time, I like to vibecode, go to the gym, and watch soccer.\n\nI chose to take this course because I have a strong passion with keeping up with emerging technologies, and the opportunity to be exposed to it in-person fascinated me; coincidentally, it fulfills my SIP credit requirement. \n\nAttached is an image of my excuse for missing Tuesday's and Thursday's classes."
